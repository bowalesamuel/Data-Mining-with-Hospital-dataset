# Data-Mining-with-Hospital-dataset

## Clustering
we used different clustering methods in this experiment.

### KMEANS
First of all, we used KMeans clustering considering several numbers of clusters 

### Evaluting KMEANS CLUSTERS 
we used two different methods of evaluating the clusters. 
Silouhette and elbow methods

### DBSCAN
Then we looked into DBScan that could pick out its optimum number of clusters.

### HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING
Finally we did Hierarchical clustering
