# Data-Mining-with-Hospital-dataset

## Clustering
we used different clustering methods in this experiment
First of all, we used KMeans clustering considering several numbers of clusters using two different methods of evaluating the clusters. Silouhette and elbow methods
Then we looked into DBScan that could pick out its optimum number of clusters.
Finally we did Hierarchical clustering
